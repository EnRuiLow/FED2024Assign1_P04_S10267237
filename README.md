This is a website that I came up with, the idea behind this is that I would like for there to be a actual good website that would actually guide people who are probably beginners or so to actually train to become a better basketballer. Thus, I created this website which would allow them to be able to train with us and to actually track their progress along the way through the usage of the pictures that they took. This would then further motivate them and they would also be able to train kind of "professionally" with the help of educated and professional coaches, thus making them no less of a student of the trainers.

## Design Process
This website is actually designed for close to everyone, but mostly for people who are probably teenagers who are interested in improving in the game of basketball. This is because of the conditioning and the drills are more aimed towards the people who are interested in going to play basketball professionally as the training could be demanding for most. My program helps them to achieve this thing by giving them a customised workout by people who are already playing for their school team or actual coaches that are outside who have qualifications to teach and help see the best results in the players. Thus, making them more conditioned and that they would have more moves or skills in order to play better in the game. Such as the On Court training program that I have provided, through practice, they would get more familiar to how the ball would go and they could also familiarize themselves with the movement of the ball etc. and that would help greatly improve their performance and their game sense.
