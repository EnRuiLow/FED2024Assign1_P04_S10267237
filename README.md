This is a website that I came up with, the idea behind this is that I would like for there to be a actual good website that would actually guide people who are probably beginners or so to actually train to become a better basketballer. Thus, I created this website which would allow them to be able to train with us and to actually track their progress along the way through the usage of the pictures that they took. This would then further motivate them and they would also be able to train kind of "professionally" with the help of educated and professional coaches, thus making them no less of a student of the trainers.
