This is a website that I came up with, the idea behind this is that I would like for there to be a actual good website that would actually guide people who are probably beginners or so to actually train to become a better basketballer. Thus, I created this website which would allow them to be able to train with us and to actually track their progress along the way through the usage of the pictures that they took. This would then further motivate them and they would also be able to train kind of "professionally" with the help of educated and professional coaches, thus making them no less of a student of the trainers.

## Design Process
This website is actually designed for close to everyone, but mostly for people who are probably teenagers who are interested in improving in the game of basketball. This is because of the conditioning and the drills are more aimed towards the people who are interested in going to play basketball professionally as the training could be demanding for most. My program helps them to achieve this thing by giving them a customised workout by people who are already playing for their school team or actual coaches that are outside who have qualifications to teach and help see the best results in the players. Thus, making them more conditioned and that they would have more moves or skills in order to play better in the game. Such as the On Court training program that I have provided, through practice, they would get more familiar to how the ball would go and they could also familiarize themselves with the movement of the ball etc. and that would help greatly improve their performance and their game sense. 

## Features
For index.html, this is the home page that would further branch down into the credentials, professionals and workout page. Thus, this is essentially my home page. On to the credentials page, you can see people like Kyrie Irving who had previously tried out the workout and have personally enjoyed it, so it is a page where famous people's comments are kept to boost the credebility of the workout. Moving on to the professionals page, there is the more famous coaches that have actually helped by adding on their own customised workout plans which they have used to train professionals with. Now, to the workout page, as you click in to the workout page, there is just two options for one to choose, which would determine which type of workout that they would be doing. For the On Court workout program, it is more concentrated on moving with the ball. But for the off the court workout program, it is more about conditioning of the users body in order for them to be in tip top condition when they are playing the game. Then, there is a finished page which gives them a cool down exercise for them to do too. Last but not least, there is a points system which allows them to take pictures of themselves during or after their workout to track their progress.

### Existing features
Allows users to have specific workout plans based on their options for "On Court" or "Off Court"

### Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea would probably be to add in a shop where the users could also buy different apparels which might help them
Maybe there could also be paid coaching which would allow them to get face to face with actual coaches and could precisely poinpoint what the user needs to improve on etc.

## Technologies used
I have used CSS, JavaScript and HTML to create this website.
Css was used mostly to help beautify and style the website,
Javascript was used to create the points system which allows the user to take more pictures to track their progress
Html was used to create the whole website mostly, for the inputing of pictures, texts, etc.
